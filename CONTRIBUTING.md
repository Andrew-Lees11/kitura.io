## Contributing to IBM-Swift/Kitura.io

This repository contains the gh-pages source for the Kitura.io website.

### Contributing to the Getting Started and Resources website pages.

You can contribute to this website by making changes to the markdown source files.
- Content for the Getting Started section can be found in the `starter` folder.
- Content for the Resources section can be found in the `resources` folder.

To find out how to install Jekyll locally to preview your changes, read the documentation on the [Jekyll docs website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Contributing to the API reference documentation

The API reference documentation is built by Jazzy from the source in the IBM-Swift/Kitura repository and added to this website from the `_includes/api` directory. 
Changes to the API reference should therefore be made in the relevant [Kitura](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura) project.
That content is regularly uplifted to the IBM-Swift/Kitura.io project.

You can find more information about contributing to IBM-Swift/Kitura in the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
